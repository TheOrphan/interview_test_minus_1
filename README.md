Furniture Finder

Exercise: You will create a single page application to search and filter furniture products. 
Please use any JS library or framework you like. Some example include React, Angular, Vue, etc -- but you're free to choose.

The app will consist of these features:
●	Search Furniture
○	A text input
○	Will display result on product list that are relevant to product name based on the keywords entered
 
●	Filter by Delivery Time
○	A dropdown input with checkbox
○	Will display result on product list based on product delivery time. Delivery time will be grouped by 4: 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, & more.
○	Multiple selection
	
●	Filter by Furniture Style
○	A dropdown input with checkbox
○	Will display result on product list based on product furniture style
○	Multiple selection

●	Product List
○	Display list of all products furniture and correlated with active filters.
○	Display product info: Product name, description (max: 114 char), price (IDR), delivery time (Day), and furniture style.

API & Mockup:
●	Using API provided in http://www.mocky.io/v2/5c9105cb330000112b649af8, 
●	follow this mockup: https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.mockflow.com/app/wireframepro/company/C69f96e47cf7744b1a55563c08b1587fe/projects/M5a10cadd5babe585815a247587e0dced1553009517182/pages/a44974d1dd4a4ee5a3d9b1965cce5240/image/a44974d1dd4a4ee5a3d9b1965cce5240.png

Evaluation Checklist:
●	Code quality & readability: Will any random engineer be able to understand the execution just by briefly scanning through the source code?
●	Engineering best practices: Does it follow proper architectural patterns (like MVC), and SOLID principles?
●	…

Submission:
●	Once the test is completed, ensure that the final page is accessible from a github page. Then send us the:
○	Link to the running application
○	Link for your github repository project.
●	See: https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/ https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
